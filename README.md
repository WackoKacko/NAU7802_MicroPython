# nau7802py
 A Python library for nau7802 using the I2C interface. This is a port of [SparkFun's Qwiic Scale Arduino library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Qwiic_Scale_NAU7802_Arduino_Library).
 
 This library has not been thoroughly tested but the basic `getReading()` and `getAverage()` functions work.
